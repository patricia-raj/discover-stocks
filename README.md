# Discover Stocks

## Project Background

Our project is to create a dashboard that will allow the end user to filter on historical trading information to affirm prior assumptions or uncover potential future trends for a given sector, portfolio, index, or single equity.

## Project Description

1)  The kind of data you'd like to work with and the field you're interested in (e.g., trading, quantitative analysis).
 *  Trading / historical portfolio analysis / portfolio optimization
2)  The kinds of questions you'll be asking of that data.
*   Best performing sectors after ‘08-‘09 recession (10yr-2yr tsy spreads)
*   Other macro events affecting the market and best returns
*   Performance around earnings release:
    -   30 day period before and after earnings call
    -   15 day period before and after earnings call
*   Price target conviction (comparing forecasts against actual performance)
3)  Possible source for such data.
