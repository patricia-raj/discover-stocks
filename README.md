# Discover Stocks

## Project Background

Summarize the top 10 companies by year in terms of market capitalization for the last 15 years to uncover marketplace trends and create a dynamic dashboard for additional analysis. Of those top companies year-over-year, which had the strongest performance over that same time period. Discover which sectors performed best after recession leading indicators (yield curve inversion) for 6, 12, and 18 month intervals. 

By conducting this analysis we hope to illustrate marketplace trends and further direct attention to certain macroeconomic signals that could potentially have a significant effect on our markets in the next 18-24 months.


## Project Description

1)  Our group first obtained data pertaining to the market capitalization for the top 10 companies each year dating back to 2006.
    * Compiled this data manually and stored in a csv file
    * Listed the top 10 companies each year
    * Displayed overall growth in terms of market capitlization across the dataset to identify companies that have become more prevalent and dominant factors in the current marketplace
2)  After identifying those high profile companies from the last 15 years, our group wanted to demonstrate performance over that same time period in hopes of uncovering additional trends.
    *   Through the use of the yfinance API we were able to compile a dataset that stored the percent change in terms of stock price to identify the top performing companies each year
        *   '08-09' Recession Impacts
        *   COVID-19 Market Pullback
        *   From 2006-2021 we see the continued fast paced growth of tech and tech related stocks
            Tesla
            Amazon
            Facebook (Meta)
            Nvidia

*   Performance around earnings release:
    -   30 day period before and after earnings call
    -   15 day period before and after earnings call
*   Price target conviction (comparing forecasts against actual performance)
3)  Possible source for such data.
